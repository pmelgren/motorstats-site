    "Since the Hybrid was introduced last July at Mid-Ohio, the public perception has been all about weight. Drivers, fans, the media, your uncle Bill, everyone agrees the Dallara DW12 was never designed to carry that much weight, and the racing has suffered as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its not all the hybrid's fault, of course, the aeroscreen added a bunch of weight long before the hybrid got here. But the combination of the two is just too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "I mean look at the last lap of the Indy 500 this year compared the the last lap last year. Last year, without the hybrid, we got a dramatic back straight overtake that decided the race and somehow led to everyone liking Pato O'Ward even more while cementing Josef Newgarden as an even bigger villain. \n",
    "\n",
    "This year? Sure there was a close battle for P1 on the last lap, but where was the dramatic overtake? Also, unlike last year, only one of the two guys battling for first was in all those Fox commercials. Clearly the hybrid sucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except this is a data blog, and INDYCAR has thousands of laps of racing every year. So a 2-lap sample size maybe feels like not enough data to draw a definitive conclusion? Ok fine."

    "Ok, with that out of the way, let's get back to the DNF problem. I follow Indycar for the racing and the strategy, not for the attrition. I'm guessing the same is true of the majoirty of my readers. So let's come up with a way that captures how much cars are able to move through the field based on speed and strategy, not due to cars in front of them DNFing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This one's actually pretty easy. If we refactor the starting grid to exclude the cars that DNF, we can calculate position movement from the on-track racing and not from attrition. To explain, we can revisit my earlier example where the pole sitter finishes 3rd and SP5 wins the race. Now let's say that the car that SP2 has a mechanical failure. In this scenario, we would adjust the starting position of cars 3-27 by 1. So the pole sitter still has a position movement of 2 (since they started in front of the DNFing car) while the winner now has a position movement of 3 (since they ultimately passed the cars in SP4, SP3 and SP1 due to speed/strategy). We'll call this Adjusted Position Movement (I know, not a 7-letter acornym).\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing the gap issue also requires a little creativity. If the first 10 cars in a race each finish half a second in front of the next car, then P11 finishes 106 seconds ahead of P12, that's an average gap of 10 seconds per car - which sounds like a boring race but clearly is not given that P1 and P11 are only separated by 5 seconds. By the same token, a race where every car finishes 10 seconds ahead of the car in front kind of is a boring race. What we need to capture is how many cars finish a competitive distance behind the car they are chasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define any gap of 3 seconds or less between 2 cars as a competitive distance. 3 seconds is a little arbitrary, and certainly we'll want to do some of that capital-S Science later on to refine this number, but for now 3 seconds feels like a small enough gap that a car could feasibly overtake within a few laps but not so small that very few cars are going to finish within that gap. We'll call this Positions at Stake and we can get a sense of how competitive an era is by calculating what percentage of positions are at stake (Position at Stake %) across an entire era.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait! One more thing before we crunch those numbers. We haven't really addressed the problem of \"how excited are we really going to get over a competitive battle for P23?\" I mean I'd rather P23 and P24 finish 1 second apart vs 30 seconds apart, but I'd even more rather P1 and P2 finish 1 second apart. To address this, we need some kind of way of assigning value to each position, with better finishing positions being assigned a higher value. Sadly no such thing exists, so I'm just going to make up an arbitrary system where P1 is awarded 50 points, P2 is awarded 40 points, the subsequent positions are awarded decreasing points until any car finishing 25th or worse receives exactly 5 points. (OK fine I stole the idea from the *Pts* column of the results data, whatever that means). For each Position at Stake as described above, I'll also calculate Points at Stake by using Indyar's base points (not bonus points). With this, I'll look at Points at Stake as a percentage of total points available (Points at Stake %) to see how competitive the racing is - but weighted by the value of the positiosn being battled over. \n",
