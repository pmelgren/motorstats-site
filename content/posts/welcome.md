## Welcome to motorStats.io

motorStats.io is a new site that is trying to bring the analytics revolution we've seen in stick-and-ball sports to INDYCAR. Our focus is on providing in-depth analysis and creating advanced metrics that help fans better understand what's happening on race day. 

### Who is behind this?

Hi, I'm Pete Melgren. I spent my 20's obsessed with advanced baseball stats (sabermetrics) and even worked in a Major League Baseball front office for 3 years doing advanced research and applied analytics using baseball data. Fast forward a decade, and I find myself tuning into multiple motorsports events every week, trying desperately to wrap my head around what's going on in the same way I do with baseball. What I found is that this doesn't really exist in the same way, at least not for INDYCAR. Fortunately INDYCAR puts all their data out there, so I've decided to do my own research (a phrase that is associated with 0 bad things) and see if I can't bring a better understanding of INDYCAR to myself and my fellow fan.

### But Doesn't Motorsports Already Have all the Data?

What? Why does that matter? Shut up.

### But Seriously What is this Site Adding?

The focus of the data for most people inside INDYCAR is engineering - making a better race car. For the fan, however, the data doesn't (yet) answer a lot of questions about the sporting/competitive side of things. We don't have great metrics on driver performance, car quality, in-race context (like expected win % on a given lap), you name it. Go read a site like [fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com) and tell me as an INDYCAR fan that this type of analysis wouldn't be fun to have during a race or to dissect after a race. 

### What should we expect from motorsports.io

To start out, my goal is just to provide an occasional post that gives fans new and interesting context they didn't have before. In the long-run, I'd love to see this site grow to have regular content and to host our own advanced stats and analytical tools, but that's not something I'll be able to do alone.

### This is cool, how can I be involved?

If you're interested in being involved please reach out! Especially if you're an INDYCAR fan with general interest in sports analytics. I'd love to collaborate!

### I think analytics are terrible and I wish you would stop ruining my sport!

If you feel that way, please go watch Moneyball. Not because it'll change your mind, it probably won't and frankly some of those scouts had good points. No, go watch Moneyball because Brad Pitt gives an unreal performance in that movie, and we sometimes don't appreciate his acting ability because he's so damn handsome. Also, hopefully by the end of the movie, you'll have forgotten about whatever on this website makes you mad and will be able to move on.
