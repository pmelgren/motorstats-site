Listen, the powers that be at motorStats.io want to bring you high quality and insightful content. Said powers are pretty much just one dude, however, and it takes time to parse, clean, analyze data and write posts. So right now the goal is to bring you new content every 2-4 weeks. 

You and I both know you're not going to check this site every day for new content if we're publishing at that rate. When I have something new I'll [tweet](https://x.com/motorstatsio) about it, but assuming you're not a robot, there's a pretty good chance you aren't on twitter. 

So I'm now offering an email newsletter that will send all the site's content to your inbox whenever it does publish. 

You can sign upvia the form below[^1]. Or you can click on the newsletter link in the side panel any time.

[^1]: motorStats.io does not have a published privacy policy,so this will have to suffice: We do not collect any PII besides your email and we only use your email to send you the site content in newsletter form. We have no plans to monetize this site and doing untoward things with people's email address frankly seems like a lot of work.
