## A

- **Adjusted Position Movement (adjPMov)**: A version of Position Movement that adjusts the starting order by removing cars that DNF, so movement reflects on-track passes/strategy rather than places gained from attrition.
- **At Stake (Position at Stake)**: A finishing-position battle where the gap between two adjacent finishers is within a “competitive” threshold (e.g., 3 seconds), indicating a plausible on-track fight.
- **At Stake %**: The percentage of finishing positions that are “at stake” (i.e., adjacent finishers are within the competitive gap threshold) across a sample of races.

## C

- **Car Failure Rate**: The rate at which cars fail to finish due to car-related issues (Mechanical, Electrical, or Fire reasons).
- **Crash Rate**: The rate at which cars fail to finish due to on-track incidents (Contact or Off Course reasons).

## D

- **DNF Rate**: The rate at which cars do not finish a race for any reason; it can be broken down into Crash Rate, Car Failure Rate, and Other Rate.

## G

- **Gap**: The time gap (in seconds) between a car and the car immediately ahead of it at the end of the race.

## M

- **Margin of Victory (MoV)**: The time gap between P1 and P2 at the end of a race.

## O

- **Other Rate**: The rate of DNFs that don’t clearly fit crash- or car-failure-related categories (e.g., Handling, Retired, DQ, DNS, In Pits).

## P

- **Points at Stake**: For a given Position at Stake, the point value assigned to the higher finishing position in that battle (used to weight battles toward the front of the field).
- **Points at Stake %**: Total Points at Stake divided by total points available across the sample; a weighted measure of how much of the race’s “valuable” finishing order was contested.
- **Position Movement (PMov)**: The absolute difference between a car’s starting position and finishing position; a simple measure of how much a car moved through the field.
